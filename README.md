# [EN] Online Pet Shop Store

This project demonstrates the essential classes required for an online pet shop storefront.  
I initially created a similar project using C++, but as a challenge, I decided to implement the same idea in Java to explore the differences between C++ and Java.  

This project showcases class hierarchies, inheritance, exception handling, and other object-oriented concepts.    
It also includes a MySQL database connection for data storage.  
A basic menu is implemented, with plans for further development.
